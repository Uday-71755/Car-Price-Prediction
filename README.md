# Car-Price-Prediction
Car Price Prediction analysis utilizing RANDOM FOREST. Initially, we can exclude the car ID from the dataset and proceed to summarize it by defining its shape and providing a description. Subsequently, the dataset can be divided into X and Y, where X comprises all the numerical data present in the dataset, and Y represents the car prices. It is essential to perform scaling due to the significant differences among the numerical values, which can be addressed by normalizing the independent features. Following the scaling process, the dataset can be partitioned into training and testing sets. The training phase will employ the random forest algorithm. Finally, we will assess the model's performance by calculating the R2_Score, which compares the true target values from the test dataset with the predicted values generated by the model. The R2_Score serves as an indicator of how accurately the model's predictions correspond to the actual values.
